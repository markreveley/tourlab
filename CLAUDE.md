# Project Instructions

## Documentation

When adding features or changing functionality:
- Update README.md to reflect the changes
- Keep the Structure section current if files are added/removed
- Update Requirements section if dependencies change
- Document new configuration options in both README and inline comments

## Code Style

- The `agent` script follows Unix philosophy: do one thing, work with pipes
- Keep bash scripts shellcheck-clean
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
