Sarah,

Perfect, thanks for the quick response. A few follow-ups:

1. Can we get load-in moved to 1pm? We're carrying a lot of soft goods.
2. What's the local crew count we should expect?
3. Do you have a runner available for the day?

Thanks,
Production Team

Hi,

1. Unfortunately 2pm is the earliest we can do - there's a corporate event wrapping up that morning. We can have extra hands ready to speed up load-in.

2. Local crew: 8 stagehands confirmed, 4 for load-in, 4 for show call. Let me know if you need more.

3. Yes, we have a runner - his name is Jake, he knows the area well. I'll send his contact info separately.

Best,
Sarah
